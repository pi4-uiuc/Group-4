# Group 4 (Outdoor-Indoor)
## Group members
* Dane Skabelund
* Dara Zirlin
* Kimberly Duran
* Qiang Wu
## Questions
* How can outdoor behavior be predicted from indoor behavior?
* Which traits are consistent across indoor and outdoor environments?
* Which combinations of traits exhibit themselves substantially differently indoors vs. outdoors?
## Data we need
The geometric plant data which is available to us is:
* canopy_cover
* canopy_height
* height
* leaf_length
* leaf_width
* plant_height

We also need weather data corresponding to the locations/dates of the observations.

## Proposed types of analysis
