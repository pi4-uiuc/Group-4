## Group members
* Dane Skabelund
* Dara Zirlin
* Kimberly Duran
* Qiang Wu
## Questions
* How can outdoor behavior be predicted from indoor behavior?
* Which traits are consistent across indoor and outdoor environments?
* Which combinations of traits exhibit themselves substantially differently indoors vs. outdoors?
## Data we need
We focus on geometric data about plants in order to compare the total yields of indoor plants 
compared to outdoor plants.
* plant geometry:
  * aboveground_dry_biomass
  * aboveground_fresh_biomass
  * canopy_cover
  * canopy_height
  * chi_leaf
  * height
  * leaf_attachment_angle
  * leaf_length
  * leaf_node_count
  * leaf_width
  * plant_height
  * stem_diameter
