# Group 4 - "Outdoor-Indoor"
## Group members
* Dane Skabelund
* Dara Zirlin
* Kimberly Duran
* Qiang Wu
## Questions( Should be revised a little bit later)
* How can outdoor behavior be predicted from indoor behavior?
* Which traits are consistent across indoor and outdoor environments?
* Which combinations of traits exhibit themselves substantially differently indoors vs. outdoors?
## Data
The geometric plant data which is available to us is:
* canopy_cover
* canopy_height
* height
* leaf_length
* leaf_width
* plant_height

We also need weather data corresponding to the locations/dates of the observations.
(Weather data available to us)
*sunDirection
*airPressure
*brightness
*relHumidity
*temperature
*windDirection
*precipitation
*windVelocity
(QUESTION:Correspondence to dates)
## Proposed types of analysis

Construction some regression models
