Project Ideas:

How to predict outdoor behavior from indoor behavior?
Which combinations of traits exhibit themselves substantially differently indoor vs outdoor?


Data we need:

plant geometry:
- height
- leaf area/length/angle/shape/number
- plant spacing
- ratio of leaf to stem in height and area

temperature of parts of plant


Proposed types of analysis:
