## Questions
* How can outdoor behavior be predicted from indoor behavior?
* Which traits are consistent across indoor and outdoor environments?
* Which combinations of traits exhibit themselves substantially differently indoors vs. outdoors?
## Data we need
We focus on geometric data about plants in order to compare the total yields of indoor plants 
compared to outdoor plants.
* plant geometry:
  * aboveground dry biomass
  * aboveground fresh biomass
  * canopy cover
  * canopy height
  * height
## Proposed types of analysis
